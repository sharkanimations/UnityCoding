All the coding I do is archived here.

WARNING!

The code that is put up here on GitHub is usable by anyone. If it is used for a
public project, please, in order to avoid unpleasant inconveniences (as a report on the site
where the project is published), to give me the right credits.

Thank you and best of luck!
